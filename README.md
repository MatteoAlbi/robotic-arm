# robotic-arm
Project developed for the high school graduation final exam.
It's a robotic arm capable to draw simple images or move objects with a claw.

## Description
The arm has been build with ordinary servo-motors and joints designed by myself using SolidWorks and created via 3D-printing.  
It has two different configurations:
- **Drawing**: the arm is equipped with a slot for a pancil. 

To control the arm in the configuration: claw, I used the radiocontroller Turnigy TGY-i6 AFHDS.
